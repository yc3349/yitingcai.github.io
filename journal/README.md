# Journal Web App

## In this document, I am going to simply address following questions:
1. I am going to state the what is the learning problem that my web-app is going to solve;
2. What am I going to build;
3. What kind of data am I collecting and how does it facilitate learning.

During my teaching at GWC, I ask my students to write journal everyday as a way to reflect on what they have learned as well as constantly improving their own understandings about computer science. The web app that we are currently using is called Blogger. I like all the functions and features it has, but I do not really like the aesthetic part of it.

For my independent project, I would like to design a new blog space, in the form of a web app, for students to write their daily journals. I want to add some features that would potentially make it fun to use, such as allowing them to add emojis or memes, and I want to make the journaling or blogging itself fun by making it look like a diary. So when users are journaling on the website, it as if they were journaling on a diary. I want to try some canvas functions. I’ve seen some of <canvas> functions before and they look really cool. I want to spend sometime to know how it works and maybe use some of the canvas features in my own project.

The data I’m collecting is mainly from the users who are inputting their journal entries. Potentially, this would be a great education tool. It would be easier for teachers or educators alike to monitor their students’ journal and make comments; while at the same time, it is going to be fun to use, especially for students.
